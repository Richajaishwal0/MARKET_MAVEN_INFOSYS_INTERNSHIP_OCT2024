# Supermarket Profit Prediction and Analysis

This repository contains a machine learning project for analyzing and predicting supermarket profits using Python. It leverages a Streamlit-based user interface for ease of interaction, data visualization, and model interpretation.

## Project Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Converts date information into year, month, and day features.
  - Handles missing values and encodes categorical data.
  - Creates a new feature for profit margin analysis.

- **Model Training**:
  - Uses a Random Forest Regressor for predicting profits.
  - Evaluates model performance with metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ².

- **Visualizations**:
  - Correlation heatmap.
  - Profit distribution.
  - Sales vs. Profit, Discount vs. Profit scatter plots.
  - Actual vs. Predicted profit comparisons.

- **Recommendations**:
  - Insights into adjusting discounts, focusing on high-profit categories, and improving profit margins.

- **Download Options**:
  - Download the trained model (`random_forest_model.pkl`).
  - Download optimized sales data.

## Files in the Repository

1. **`Final_supermartdata.csv`**: The dataset used for training and analysis.
2. **`Model_train.py`**: The main Python script for data preprocessing, training the model, and deploying the Streamlit interface.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone (https://github.com/SpringBoardMentor193s/MARKET_MAVEN_INFOSYS_INTERNSHIP_OCT2024/Madhu_Project
